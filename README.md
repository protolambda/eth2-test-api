# muskoka-worker

Wrapper around Eth2 consensus state machines, to run state transitions on demand,
 and upload results to a shared service.
This can then be triggered, diffed between clients, and stay tracked on a website.

Also see [`muskoka-server`](https://github.com/protolambda/muskoka-server).
